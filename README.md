NCallerIdSpam
This Tampermonkey script allows you to automatically spam NoCallerId calls using Google Voice.

How to Use:
Import the Script into Tampermonkey.

Visit voice.google.com.

Look for the overlay in the top-right corner of the page.



Enter the phone number and the number of spam attempts (loops).



Set the delay (1-10ms) for number input.



Adjust the wait time between calls. For spam purposes, I recommend a setting of 2.9-3 seconds before ending and recalling the call.
